# Song Lyrics Generation

This repository contains the code for our CSC413 project at the University of Toronto. We have built a machine learning solution that generates song lyrics given a user prompt. We explore and compare different deep learning approaches for this task.

The folder `fine-tune-gpt` contains the code to fine-tune and evaluate a GPT model on song lyrics data. The `song_lyric_generator.ipynb` notebook contains the code to train and evaluate various models that are based on the LSTM and GAN architecture.
